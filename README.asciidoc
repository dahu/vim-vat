Vim Vat

__A pile of files is just not Hipp__

TIP: If you like Vim Vat and want to share the W00t!, I'm grateful for

NOTE: Vim Vat is not intended for serious use.

NOTE: Vim Vat depends on http://www.sqlite.org/[SQLite]

DBRead
~~~~~~

  :DBRead db-file.vat://path/to/file.type

The `:DBRead` command supports completion of `.vat` files (sqlite3
databases) and the files within them.

The normal Vim commands `:e` and `:w` also work for Vim Vat files.
